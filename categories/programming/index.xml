      <description>This week I had an homework assignment in class that actually caught my attention. Here is why and how I went about accomplishing it.
TL;DR: Check bottom of this post for the code I finished. Creates a watermark hidden in a picture using python discrete wavelet transforms.
The Challenge My professor handed me a python script which broke apart a generic photo into four varying detailed photos in grayscale.
As you can see there are four differing types of detail in this image that have been broken apart.</description>
