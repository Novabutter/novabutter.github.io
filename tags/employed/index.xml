      <description>Professional Career Space (I got a job) After many months of searching, applying, and interviews I got a professional offer from MasterCard and I accepted it. Currently I am a Linux Systems Engineer which is less security than I had preferred but no doubt is an excellent and relevant start to my next chapter in life. I get to be in a terminal where I am most comfortable, there still is security involved, and I get to talk to individuals who can only further advance my knowledge.</description>
