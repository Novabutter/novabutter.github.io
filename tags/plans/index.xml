      <description>Professional Career Space (I got a job) After many months of searching, applying, and interviews I got a professional offer from MasterCard and I accepted it.

I don&amp;rsquo;t have school and currently my job working for the school is ending by the end of the week, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be out of work to.</description>
