## Feb. 3 - Feb 9 Learning Sprint

This is a weekly learning sprint update. For a larger outlook on what I am doing to, check out my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/6oD5SGbb/personal-board) which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of. 

Last week I learned plenty, but only a few items. My time was well invested but poorly planned. I spent hours upon hours dedicating myself to a task's completion. While this completed the bigger tasks I suffered on total task completion. This week, I'll be setting a timer per activity to ensure that my time does not role over.

While most of these tasks are roll over from last week, here is what I plan to learn. After this week, this list should be near completed and I'll be able to inherit many tasks from the upcoming week.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Develop final iterations of Cyber Range Logo
- [ ]  Finish the Kali Linux Revealed book
- [ ]  Start Metasploit Unleashed book
- [ ]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Research MaaS (for work)

Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Cyber Defense Team Studying
- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Docker Course
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  SMTP & IMAP Setup in Virtual Lab

I'll report back on how I did at the end of the sprint. Cheers.
