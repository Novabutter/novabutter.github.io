_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint and the announcement of moving my blog from wordpress to here._

## Moving Blog

For about 4 months now I've been hosting my blog on wordpress to show my updates. That was absolutely fine. Tools were easy, posts had no issue. But I've found that increasingly individuals in the Cybersecurity world have been posting their guides and successes to github rather than to an external blog. So that's what I'll be doing; moving to github. 

Over the next week or so I'll be moving posts from wordpress to github, so there will be slightly more activity than usual. Anyway, enough of that.

## Jan. 20-26 Learning Review

Last week I had quite a few things to do. I was a bit worried about school starting getting in the way of some of my learning, but nonetheless I was confident I could do well. 

Well....I didn't do great.

Most of the items I had planned simply never happened and it wasn't due to lack of time. My interests were all over the place and I ended up going down multiple rabbit holes of things I _wanted_ to learn rather than had scheduled. I'll explain in a second, but below is what I had planned versus what I accomplished:

My intended focuses:

- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ] Finish Developing a Logo for the Cyber Range
- [ ] Try out the tool: Searchsploit
- [x] Finish the Mastering Linux Security Hardening course
- [x] Study how SSH Tunnels work
- [ ] Finish the Kali Linux Revealed book
- [ ] Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ] Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [x] Start a Docker Course
- [ ] Research MaaS (for work)

Repeating Activities include:

- [x] Cyber Defense Team Studying
- [x] Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ] Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ] Update Passwords
- [ ] SMTP & IMAP Setup in Virtual Lab

So as you can see, I didn't do all too great on completing nearly any items. Most of my distractions actually were not my usual ones; like I said I went down a few rabbit holes. One of those holes was moving from Windows 10 Home to Windwos 10 Pro and setting up RDP. I was informed that it was simply not possible to move OSs like that without a complete reinstall. I had no desire to do that, so instead what I did was clever enough to get upgrade my system and play with RDP. And yes that is pretty much the only reason I had any desire to upgrade. While playing with RDP, I've been researching and experimenting with SSH Tunneling and RDP, but so far I've had no luck. On my Debian OS I can't install `xrdp` with my updated NVIDIA drivers  while on Windows I fiddled around with the SSH Server to no avail. 

So most of my tasks were a bust, and therefore will be the focus of this week strongly. I will not fall down rabbit holes nor will I have any massive system upgrades to work on/with. I'm proud I got  to do some research on SSH Tunneling, finish my hardening course, and especially begin a Docker course. Hopefully this week I'll be able to be more productive and focused....with little homework.
