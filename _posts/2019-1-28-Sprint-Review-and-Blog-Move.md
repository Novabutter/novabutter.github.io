## Jan. 20-26 Learning Review

This last week I was quite productive in my efforts to learn, however I did not stay "on-track". I had many additional side projects for work which consumed a great amount of my time, but nonetheless I did learn. 

Most of the items here that I did not complete I moved to a different week for prioritization purposes. On the contrary what I did complete took time and I tended to be sucked into that.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Finish Developing a Logo for the Cyber Range
- [X]  Finish Cyber Range Website(s)
- [X]  Try out the tool: Searchsploit
- [ ]  Finish the Kali Linux Revealed book
- [ ]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Research MaaS (for work)

Repeating Activities include:

- [X]  Cyber Defense Team Studying
- [X]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Docker Course
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  SMTP & IMAP Setup in Virtual Lab

### Review

As you can see, there are a lot of blanks. Part of the reason was the website(s). They took nearly all of my spare time. So I am proud that I was able to focus on the task and do a good job but it came at the expense of other activities. Otherwise I enjoyed doing the Web Developer Bootcamp and studying for the Cyber Defense Team. I made several scripts which I uploaded to github to help lock down my machine during competition. 


### Takeaway
What I need to improve on is time management. I tended to hyper focus on one activity until it was done. While this does accomplish a task completely, it does (as you can see) make my completion level look quite low. Had I kept to the strict time limits I had made for myself as well as not waking up later in the day, I would have finished many more tasks. This upcoming week I plan on setting a countdown timer for each task I have so I know when my time is up. This way I can move on to the next activity.
