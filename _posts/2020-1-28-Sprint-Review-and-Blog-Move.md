_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint and the announcement of moving my blog from wordpress to here._

## Moving Blog

For about 4 months now I've been hosting my blog on wordpress to show my updates. That was absolutely fine. Tools were easy, posts had no issue. But I've found that increasingly individuals in the Cybersecurity world have been posting their guides and successes to github rather than to an external blog. So that's what I'll be doing; moving to github. 

Over the next week or so I'll be moving posts from wordpress to github, so there will be slightly more activity than usual. Anyway, enough of that.


## Jan. 20-26 Learning Review

This last week I was quite productive in my efforts to learn, however I did not stay "on-track". I had many additional side projects for work which consumed a great amount of my time, but nonetheless I did learn. 

Most of the items here that I did not complete I moved to a different week for prioritization purposes. On the contrary what I did complete took time and I tended to be sucked into that.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Finish Developing a Logo for the Cyber Range
- [X]  Finish Cyber Range Website(s)
- [X]  Try out the tool: Searchsploit
- [ ]  Finish the Kali Linux Revealed book
- [ ]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Research MaaS (for work)

Repeating Activities include:

- [X]  Cyber Defense Team Studying
- [X]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Docker Course
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  SMTP & IMAP Setup in Virtual Lab

### Review

As you can see, there are a lot of blanks. Part of the reason was the website(s). They took nearly all of my spare time. So I am proud that I was able to focus on the task and do a good job but it came at the expense of other activities. Otherwise I enjoyed doing the Web Developer Bootcamp and studying for the Cyber Defense Team. I made several scripts which I uploaded to github to help lock down my machine during competition. 


### Takeaway
What I need to improve on is time management. I tended to hyper focus on one activity until it was done. While this does accomplish a task completely, it does (as you can see) make my completion level look quite low. Had I kept to the strict time limits I had made for myself as well as not waking up later in the day, I would have finished many more tasks. This upcoming week I plan on setting a countdown timer for each task I have so I know when my time is up. This way I can move on to the next activity.
