_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint. I nailed it this week!_

## Apr. 20 - May 3 Learning Review

This past few weeks (I missed the preview week review and post) I learned a small amount. I did accomplish a few things on my list, though not nearly as many as I had previously wanted. Most of my items were disappointingly long, but I did follow my time-constraint suggestions to the best of my ability which when I was working did help. Here is what I did over the past 2 weeks.

My intended focuses:

- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ] Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ] NTP & Nextcloud Servers Lab
- [ ] Install Working Windows Server 2019 on Cyber Range (for work)
- [X] Finish work on Cyber Range backup deployment server (for work)


Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Continue [Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course](https://github.com/connormcgarr/An-Intro-2-Win-ED) (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [X]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 

I did apply for many jobs and worked on a majority of the items here. Unfortunately I did not finish many of them simply because they were time consuming and I had mis-estimated how long they would take. My plan is to improve the focused amount of time that I'll be learning as well as introducing another possible course (read my next post) in the near future to focus on. 

My lack of accomplishment is not completely to blame on time; I was distracted for the previous two weeks. I'll be honest when I say I watched a ton of Netflix, was hanging out with my family, and applied for many, many jobs. While I did do work, I did not apply myself as well as I could have.
