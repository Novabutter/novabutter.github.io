_My weekly learning sprint plan._

## Apr. 14 - Apr. 19 Learning Sprint

This is a weekly learning sprint update. The purpose is to outline my goals and tasks of learning throughout the week. At the end of each weekly I will evaluate my completed and incomplete tasks hoping to identify and streamline my best working/learning habits. Additionally, those that read here can see what I’m up to and track my weekly progress. For a larger outlook on what I’m up to, check out my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/6oD5SGbb/personal-board) which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of. 

Last week, I essentially got nothing accomplished on this list. So with some new time management skills and focus I should have little issue completing my intended focuses.

Slowly chipping away at my constantly rolling-over list. Here are my plans.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Light Splunk Learning
- [ ]  Finish brief Null-Byte Linux Series
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ]  Clean Up Cyber Range Website (for work)
- [ ]  Finish work on Cyber Range backup deployment server (for work)


Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance.
