_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint. This week was piss-poor._

## Mar. 23 - 29 Learning Review

Last week I was moving around a lot from school to home. I got very little done in this list, but outside the list I finished plenty. I focused a lot on other work that needed to be done. Now I'll be able to focus on these things going into next week.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Light Splunk Learning
- [ ]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ]  Finish work on Cyber Range backup deployment server (for work)


Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [X]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 

What I did finish was Applying for jobs. I applied for 2 jobs and worked on creating images for my job at school. Outside of this, I also worked plenty on my other relating startup company work, of which I cannot disclose here.

To improve in time, I'll be etching out realistic timelines per day with a timer on how long I'm allowed to spend on a project. I tend to forcefully try to finish one task that I've started, and it usually rolls over into other planned projects. This is fine on occasion but lately has been a frequent occurrence which hurts me more than helps.
