_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint._

## May 4 - May 10 Learning Review

Over the past week I was absolutely slammed with last minute work for my school projects as I approach graduation. Most of it was long essays that just took time and weren't of any relating value. Some of them my professors assigned out of nowhere and they were due within less than 24 hours because they still had content to cover. Due to this fact (and a few more that are not school realted), I did not accomplish as much as I had hoped.

My intended focuses:

- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ] Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ] NTP & Nextcloud Servers Lab
- [X] Finish Up Final Work for the Cyber Range


Repeating Activities include:

- [X]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Continue [Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course](https://github.com/connormcgarr/An-Intro-2-Win-ED) (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [X]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script (v1.0)
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 
- [X]  HTB (Retired) Walkthroughs


While I did finish up work on the Cyber Range for the most part with minimal loose-ends to tie up as of right now, I did not finish the rest of these projects. I applied for many jobs this week and continued to go through my Web Developer Course. In my spare time I watched HackTheBox walkthroughs of retired machines and that was actually quite beneficial. 

Unfortunately, the SMTP & IMAP Lab project I am still having trouble deploying. Issues keep re-appeareing and it is taking much longer than expected to get it working. At this point for time's sake, I am considering abandoning the project. The NTP & Nextcloud Servers lab I have been holding off on because I know there is a plugin that exists for the Nextcloud lab that one can connect an SMTP server which I had planned to tie in. As far as the Metasploit course and the Intro to Windows Exploit Development, I simply ran out of time between school and a few other projects. Obviously the non-focused activities are somewhat optional so I won't explain those.

As for this upcoming week, I am currently engrossed in final exams. I'll post my upcoming learning sprint after I finish.
