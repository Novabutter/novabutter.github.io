_My weekly learning sprint plan._

## May 13 - May 17 Learning

As always, this is a weekly learning sprint update. The purpose is to outline my goals and tasks of learning throughout the week. At the end of each weekly I will evaluate my completed and incomplete tasks hoping to identify and streamline my best working/learning habits. Additionally, those that read here can see what I’m up to and track my weekly progress. For a larger outlook on what I’m up to, check out my Trello Board which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of. 

This past week I was mostly focused on the finishing school, so I got very little done. However, my next post is going to review my brand new outline for my timeline for the next few months. Based on that, here is focus for this week.

My intended focuses:

- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ] Attempt to finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ] NTP & Nextcloud Servers Lab
- [ ] Finish Up Final Work for the Cyber Range

Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script (v1.0)
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 
- [ ]  HTB (Retired) Walkthroughs

My focus is going to be heavily focused on finishing the tasks at hand. These need to be completed quickly in anticipation for my upcoming timeline of events over the next few months. This week is meant to wrap up a few loose ends. My main focus is going to be completing the Windows Exploit Development Course and a few previous items from the week before. As for the SMTP & IMAP lab, it is taking quite a bit longer than expected with a multitude of issues. I need to shift my focus to other avenues before continually sinking more time into this. So that is why it reads "attempt". If I can't figure out the issues that it is presenting within a reasonable number of hours, I'm going to abandon the project for the time being and return to it later. 

The rest I shouldn't have an problem accomplishing. Even the additional non-focused activities I need to finish and I will up until Sunday.
