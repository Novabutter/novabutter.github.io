## Feb. 10 - Feb 16 Learning Sprint

This is a weekly learning sprint update. For a larger outlook on what I am doing to, check out my Trello Board which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of. 

Last week I prioritized my tasks and started/finished what needed to be done. However the completion level of said tasks was rather low. This was all the fault of my own, but nonetheless I'm proud of my work. I started so many things last week that this week I should be able to officially complete these tasks. Most of them I am near done with or half-way through. 

With that said, I do compete this week in the Missouri State CCDC competition on February 11th. 90% of my focus will go to last minute preparing for this competition along with any homework I receive. So _if_ these tasks are started at all this week, it will be at the end of the week after my competition. We've all ready gotten access to a practice environment and I've found several backdoors on my box. ;)

My intended focuses:
- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Develop final iterations of Cyber Range Logo
- [ ]  Finish the Kali Linux Revealed book
- [ ]  Start Metasploit Unleashed book
- [ ]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Research MaaS (for work)

Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Cyber Defense Team Studying
- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Docker Course
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  SMTP & IMAP Setup in Virtual Lab

All of these tasks are roll over from last week. After this week, this list should be near completed and I'll be able to inherit many tasks from the upcoming week. I should also mention that my priorities in learning will be shifting from the cool stuff I want to learn to thing I need to learn for my job. Additionally, some extra posts on what I have been doing in my personal lab will become available I hope around the same time. 

Cheers!
