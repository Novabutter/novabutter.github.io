_My weekly learning sprint plan. Course-week!_

## Apr. 14 - Apr. 19 Learning Sprint

This is a weekly learning sprint update. The purpose is to outline my goals and tasks of learning throughout the week. At the end of each weekly I will evaluate my completed and incomplete tasks hoping to identify and streamline my best working/learning habits. Additionally, those that read here can see what I’m up to and track my weekly progress. For a larger outlook on what I’m up to, check out my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/6oD5SGbb/personal-board) which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of. 

Last week I did quite well on my own being productive and attacking my intended focuses. This week I intend to be as motivated, however this week has less intended focuses. 

My intended focuses:

- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ] Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ] NTP & Nextcloud Servers Lab
- [ ] Install Working Windows Server 2019 on Cyber Range (for work)
- [ ] Finish work on Cyber Range backup deployment server (for work)


Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Continue Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 

The reason for the smaller list overall is due to the amount of "courses" I'm enrolled in. In the repeating activities section, I am trying to complete three separate courses, two of which are remotely related. I do not want to complete small portions of a course each week to drag them on indefinitely. So my focus this week is less on the amount I can accomplish and learn and more on completing a few tasks with in-depth learning through coursework. 

Here's to me learning on my own for a productive and satisfying week. I'll be back next week with a review of how I did and possibly during the week a review on completing the CTF challenge.
