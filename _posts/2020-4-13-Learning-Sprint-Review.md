_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint. Minus skipping a week of posting, results were still poor._

## Mar. 30 - April 12 Learning Review

Minus skipping a week, I did not get as much done as I had hoped. I got distracted with a few games, some actual awesome productivity, and homework. Despite this, I did finish a few things, which lately has been rather rare.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Light Splunk Learning
- [X]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ]  Finish work on Cyber Range backup deployment server (for work)


Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue [Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course](https://github.com/connormcgarr/An-Intro-2-Win-ED) (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [X]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance.

Okay I know it looks bad. I didn't do what I said I would with the times. Honestly most of my issue comes with oversleeping on the new COVID school schedule. I was able to finally finis that YouTube Series that has been sitting in my account playlist for a year now. I also applied for about 8+ jobs over the course of the past few weeks. Now last week while not on the list of things I wanted to accomplish, and impromptu opportunity arrived on my doorstep. You can check out my new tool called parition-resize on my github. It was a blast making it, but boy did I sink a several hours into it. So I am proud of all of these things.

To improve this week, I am working on adjusting my sleeping schedule and utilizing the countdown timers I so much talk about. As an additional safety net, I'm going to allocate 1.5+ hours of "spare time" so if any distractions, random opportunities/curses, or otherwise pop-up, my plans won't be runied so I'll continue to be motivated.
