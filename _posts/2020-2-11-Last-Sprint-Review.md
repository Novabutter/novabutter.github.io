_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint._

## Feb. 3 - 9 Learning Review

Last week I was actually pretty light on homework. I focused on other things outside of the scope of my Trello learning as well as inside of it. Since the CCDC competition is this upcoming week (last week it was 2 weeks away) most of my focus was on learning security for my box. Thankfully, this was on my Trello board of things to do so some of it counted, but I still failed to organize enough to get a lot of things done. 

I'm not too dissatisfied with the amount of things I learned, but I still have a bit to go when it comes to accomplishing tasks in a timely manner. Here's what I finished versus what I missed the planned mark on:

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ]  Develop final iterations of Cyber Range Logo
- [ ]  Finish the Kali Linux Revealed book
- [ ]  Finish a YouTube Series on Linux Administration
- [ ]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Research MaaS (for work)

Repeating Activities include:

- [x]  Cyber Defense Team Studying
- [x]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue Docker Course
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  SMTP & IMAP Setup in Virtual Lab

Okay okay. I know it looks like I did basically nothing. _But_, I did actually do small things in each category of my intended focuses. I worked on the Bandit challenge (to no avail) for over an hour, did some small things with the Cyber Range Logo, am near finished with the Kali Linux Revealed book, went through some of the Linux Admin course, and took a light gander at the Metasploit Unleashed course. So they are marked as incomplete because I didn't complete them, but I did get close to or work in some capacity on all of them. On a side note, I spent 4 of my curious hours setting up a SMTP & IMAP server which is taking much longer than I had anticipated.

On a side note, my focus was absolutely prioritized for the Cyber Defense Team. So while my work seems incomplete I did also keep my focus in the right place. I'm proud of what I have done, but I still have to finish all these tasks. I should be next week no problem (as most of them are started or close to done).
