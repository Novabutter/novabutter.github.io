_My weekly learning sprint plan. Course-week!_

## May 4 - May 10 Learning Sprint

As always, this is a weekly learning sprint update. The purpose is to outline my goals and tasks of learning throughout the week. At the end of each weekly I will evaluate my completed and incomplete tasks hoping to identify and streamline my best working/learning habits. Additionally, those that read here can see what I’m up to and track my weekly progress. For a larger outlook on what I’m up to, check out my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/6oD5SGbb/personal-board) which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of. 

The past few weeks I actually was decently distracted. Now, nearly rightfully so (being a bit burned out with the whole COVID epidemic), but nonetheless was not as productive as I had wanted to be. During this time I applied for jobs and focused on school, work, friends, and family. Now I am back at it this week hoping to lock-down my focus, graduate soon, and keep learning. Here is what I plan on realistically doing this week as I hone back in.

My intended focuses:

- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [ ] Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [ ] NTP & Nextcloud Servers Lab
- [ ] Finish Up Final Work for the Cyber Range


Repeating Activities include:

- [ ]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Continue Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [ ]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script (v1.0)
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 
- [ ]  HTB (Retired) Walkthroughs

Now, I still want to continue focusing on my courses learning as closely as I can because as you can see I have 3 courses open. I need to start knocking them out. Additionally I'll be applying for a course here soon that is much more rigorous and time-demanding compared to these, so I need to work on them _NOW_. 

I have also added HTB walkthroughs as an additional non-focused activity. This is for me getting into HTB. I need to soon, but I have to go through the Metasploit course I feel first. Once I get through that, I should be able to at least hop on HTB with a VIP subscription. Watching the retired walkthroughs gives me a glimpse at the mindset, process, and complexity of the boxes. Meanwhile, I am being entertained and challenged by the Bandit CTFs. I'll get there one day.

Outside of this the other intended focuses are light as I approach graduation as well as keep my focus on the courses. To streamline my efficiency, I will keep 1-4 hours each day open for distraction or additional time as well as keep on my countdown timer constraints. 

I will report on how I did at the end of the week, so be ready for a lot of checked boxes.
