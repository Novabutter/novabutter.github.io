_A personal review of my previous week's learning sprint. I nailed it this week!_

## Apr. 14 - Apr. 19 Learning Review

I did a fantastic amount of learning this week and was able to if not complete, work on nearly every single item I had intended to complete. I was able to learn some basics about Splunk, finish multiple Linux Basics series I have had stocked for a while, do some reading on articles and work on the courses I have been doing in parallel. Here is what I got done from last week.

My intended focuses:

- [ ]  Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.
- [X]  Light Splunk Learning
- [X]  Finish brief Null-Byte Linux Series
- [X]  Start the Metasploit Unleashed course/book
- [ ]  Finish SMTP & IMAP Lab
- [X]  Clean Up Cyber Range Website (for work)
- [ ]  Finish work on Cyber Range backup deployment server (for work)


Repeating Activities include:

- [X]  Continue Web Developer Bootcamp
- [ ]  Continue [Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course](https://github.com/connormcgarr/An-Intro-2-Win-ED) (courtesy of Connor McGarr)
- [X]  Apply for Jobs

Additional Non-Focused Activities:

- [ ]  Update Passwords
- [ ]  Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script
- [ ]  Update github blog appearance. 


This week was quite productive in terms of focus. Some of it was due to the minimal homework, but so much of it was pure motivation and scheduling. Now, while it may not look like much, everything on the intended focuses list is the primary goals of my week. I focus on those and the repeating activitiesâ€”if I get distracted or not as motivated I am allowed to take a break with the non-focused activities. All of the intended focuses I worked on but was unable to complete as they took longer than I had expected. That said, I had a ton of fun doing all of these things.

My best aid was scheduling an additional one to two hours of time a day as "distraction" or spare time. If my schedule was thrown off early in the day or I worked longer on something than I was supposed to I had a large enough cushion to recover. This also helps me not overload myself on any given day. If I get behind on more than two activities I had planned for the day, I tend to be immediately de-motivated and everything for that day spirals out of control to where I accomplish little to nothing. Having that bubble of time to fall on is perfect as I can move items back or use that time for any distractions I may receive. 

I am quite proud of what I was able to accomplish and will continue to incorporate my findings into the following weeks.
