## About

Normally I do not find myself impressive in any way whatsoever. I do not claim to be an programming wizard, code novice, or even a rookie. Coding is not my forte.

With that said, finding an issue, documenting it, and correcting is quite satisfying. I do believe that with enough time I will be able to be at least a novice programmer, but my focus is not so much on creating projects or code. At heart, I am a penetration tester. A young, inexperienced, motivated, curious, and creative pen tester. Soon anyway. 

Throughout the brief journey into my Cybersecurity field even so far, I have run into this thing called programming. More of my time is spent in frustartion that peace upon correction of my findings. I know few languages, but I understand the general format of them and can more or less understand what is happening in a given program. Even then, creating solutions via programming, finding bugs, etcetera is part of what I need to learn and become fair at. Along the way, my discoveries will be pushed and placed here.

## So far...

So far I am beginning my journey. I do not have much but a structured outline on what I want to learn, a few resources, and school. However, I do have some links for you to follow my progress, plans, and accomplishments. Track my personal progress and see the projects I either plan to work on or am currently working with:
