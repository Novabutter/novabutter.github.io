    <h2 id="may-4---may-10-learning-sprint">May 4 - May 10 Learning Sprint</h2>
<p>As always, this is a weekly learning sprint update. The purpose is to outline my goals and tasks of learning throughout the week. At the end of each weekly I will evaluate my completed and incomplete tasks hoping to identify and streamline my best working/learning habits. Additionally, those that read here can see what I’m up to and track my weekly progress. For a larger outlook on what I’m up to, check out my Trello Board which changes daily &amp; is what my weeks are based off of.</p>
<p>The past few weeks I actually was decently distracted. Now, nearly rightfully so (being a bit burned out with the whole COVID epidemic), but nonetheless was not as productive as I had wanted to be. During this time I applied for jobs and focused on school, work, friends, and family. Now I am back at it this week hoping to lock-down my focus, graduate soon, and keep learning. Here is what I plan on realistically doing this week as I hone back in.</p>
<p>My intended focuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Complete OverTheWire Bandit CTF.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish SMTP &amp; IMAP Lab</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> NTP &amp; Nextcloud Servers Lab</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish Up Final Work for the Cyber Range</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeating Activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Continue Web Developer Bootcamp</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Metasploit Unleashed course/book</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Continue Introduction to Windows Exploit Development Course (courtesy of Connor McGarr)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Apply for Jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Non-Focused Activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Update Passwords</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Finish OpenVPN Autodeployment script (v1.0)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Update github blog appearance.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> HTB (Retired) Walkthroughs</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I still want to continue focusing on my courses learning as closely as I can because as you can see I have 3 courses open. I need to start knocking them out. Additionally I&rsquo;ll be applying for a course here soon that is much more rigorous and time-demanding compared to these, so I need to work on them <em>NOW</em>.</p>
<p>I have also added HTB walkthroughs as an additional non-focused activity. This is for me getting into HTB. I need to soon, but I have to go through the Metasploit course I feel first. Once I get through that, I should be able to at least hop on HTB with a VIP subscription. Watching the retired walkthroughs gives me a glimpse at the mindset, process, and complexity of the boxes. Meanwhile, I am being entertained and challenged by the Bandit CTFs. I&rsquo;ll get there one day.</p>
<p>Outside of this the other intended focuses are light as I approach graduation as well as keep my focus on the courses. To streamline my efficiency, I will keep 1-4 hours each day open for distraction or additional time as well as keep on my countdown timer constraints.</p>
<p>I will report on how I did at the end of the week, so be ready for a lot of checked boxes.</p>
