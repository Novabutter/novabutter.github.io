    <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Exploit Development is an art that only a select few venture to explore. So many of us run the script and watch it fail only to sit back and think <em>well that didn&rsquo;t work. Oh well.</em> It takes enormous amounts of time, knowledge, and Googling while testing, failing, and failing a thousand more times until finally something happens. It&rsquo;s these individuals that frighten the world; that have the motivation to press onward into nearly always unfamiliar territory to find vulnerabilities in applications for the good or bad. And lucky for us, many of them have the heart to share their findings in order to train those with the same motivation but without the compass.</p>
<p>With the help of the <a href="https://github.com/connormcgarr/An-Intro-2-Win-ED">Intro to Windows Exploit Development Course</a> we&rsquo;ll build an exploit against a vulnerable driver utilizing <a href="https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver">Vulnserver</a> using a vanilla buffer overflow with ASLR and DEP disabled.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-wswell-some-of-them">All the W&rsquo;s&hellip;well some of them.</h2>
<h3 id="where">Where</h3>
<p>The <strong>essfunc.dll</strong> of <strong>vulnserver.exe</strong> running on Windows 7 x86 (32-bit) machine with ASLR and DEP disabled.</p>
<h3 id="what">What</h3>
<p>The vulnerable command of the application is <code>TRUN</code> command. We don&rsquo;t know what this does, but we&rsquo;ll soon find out how it is vulnerable.</p>
<h3 id="why-disable-aslr-and-dep">Why disable ASLR and DEP?</h3>
<p>ASLR and DEP are Address Space Layout Randomization and Data Execution Prevention respectively. The former is responsible for scrambling memory addresses on each boot of the machine, while the latter is a mitigation which prevents the execution of foreign code on the stack of the thread (threads are contained inside a what Windows calls a process). With DEP, the stack can either be written to or what is on the stack may be executed, but both cannot happen concurrently. Both are attempts (and can be decent ones at that) of which to prevent binary exploitation. There&rsquo;s a lot more to both of these mitigations that are outside the scope of this post.</p>
<p>The reason these mitigations need to be disabled are for educational purposes. Keeping memory addresses static (disabling ASLR) allows us to hard code memory addresses into the exploit for now which is easier than finding the vulnerabilities in ASLR itself being far outside the scope of a vanilla buffer overflow. The same goes for DEP; it&rsquo;s not the best mitigation tool in practice but having to deal with first learning about the stack and seeing how it can be abused by writing and executing are the basics.</p>
<p>There is no need to have your arms and legs handcuffed when learning how to walk.</p>
<h2 id="basecamp-prepping-for-the-journey">Basecamp: Prepping for the Journey</h2>
<p>Before we begin there are few key terms to point out that are often referenced. We need to know what and where our gear is before we begin hiking.</p>
<h4 id="32-bit-registers">32-bit registers</h4>
<p>Registers are used to transfer data through the OS. x86 and x64 systems each have different registers, but any 32-bit application will run with the same registers regardless of the system. There are nine registers in the x86 architecture, of which three are vitally important when discussing the stack and building out exploit:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ESP</strong>: Stack pointer to the top of the stack.</li>
<li><strong>EBP</strong>: Base pointer to the beginning/bottom of the stack frame.</li>
<li><strong>EIP</strong>: Instruction pointer pointing to the current memory address of the instructions being executed.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-stack">The Stack</h4>
<p>The stack is a pretty common sight for a programmer; it&rsquo;s the first-in, last-out philosophy of interpretation of instructions. While it seems decently simple it can be a challenge to initially wrap one&rsquo;s head around.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/Stack.png" alt="General Picture of a Stack"></p>
<p>Here you can see the representation of a single stack frame (the stack itself is something different). This section of instructions in memory from high addresses down to low addresses as the stack grows downward. The registers mentioned above are filled with the memory addresses of these locations so the machine knows where the beginning, end, and current section of execution inside of the stack are. In this post we&rsquo;ll be overflowing these locations intentionally with our own memory locations.</p>
<p>As this post is a light review of the contents of a course, the explanation on how buffer overflows work is outside of its scope.</p>
<h4 id="windbg">WinDbg</h4>
<p>A standard debugger developed my Microsoft that allows developers (and exploit developers) to follow the low-level behavior of an application.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/WinDbg.png" alt="Layout of WinDgb"></p>
<p>With this tool we can look at CPU registers and what their values are, monitor and pause program behavior, and take a look inside the memory space of the application thread.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzing-the-application">Fuzzing the Application</h2>
<p>Now we can begin the process of developing our exploit. In our case finding out where exactly to start looking for our vulnerability is first and we can continue onward from there. What we do know is that the vulnerable command of the application is <code>TRUN</code>, so let&rsquo;s start there. In the case of vulnserver, the server is waiting for connections and interaction on port 9999. Interacting with <code>TRUN</code> normally, it expects a small dataset like an integer or string.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/TRUN-command.png" alt="TRUN command interaction"></p>
<p>What if we fed it quite a bit more than that? After all <code>TRUN</code> is a command and therefore a function with limited space on the stack that we may be able to overflow to reach areas of memory we shouldn&rsquo;t have access to. These set of actions are known as &ldquo;Fuzzing&rdquo;. Fuzzing is the process of attempting to force unintended behavior of a program ideally resulting in a crash or exception. This can be achieved by sending any data the application may not expect to interpret. What if we built a simple script to just send a massive string or set of characters? Let&rsquo;s try sending 5,000 &lsquo;A&rsquo; characters with the <code>TRUN</code> command to see what happens.</p>

<p>Would you look at that! We crashed the program. And if we check our register values, we can see that both EIP and EIP were overwritten with the hex value for &lsquo;A&rsquo;, <code>\x41</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/vuln-crash-registers.png" alt="vuln server overwritten registers"></p>
<p>Additionally, if we take a look at the memory location that <strong>ESP</strong> is pointing to (<code>0x18ff9e0</code>), you can see that we have also overwritten the values at ESP.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/vuln-crash-esp.png" alt="vuln server overwritten registers"></p>
<p>This means we know that sending 5,000 bytes will give us control of the three key registers! What does this mean? Well, as EIP is controlled, this means that whatever is put into that register will be executed (remember DEP is disabled). So now the name of the game is probably getting EIP to execute our own code somehow. The issue is we while we know we control that register, we don&rsquo;t exactly know how many bytes it took to get to EIP—we only know that it is controllable. So how do we find out?</p>
<h2 id="controlling-the-crash">Controlling the Crash</h2>
<p>To find out where EIP is, we need to generate some sort of unique string pattern that&rsquo;s at least 5,000 bytes long so we can crash the application. With the unique pattern, we can can search whichever characters appear in EIP again and find out exactly how many bytes lead up to EIP. Thankfully Metasploit contains a ruby script that will do just that for us. All we have to do is run the following command to generate our unique pattern:</p>
<p><code>/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l [number of bytes]</code></p>
<p>This will generate our pattern for us. From here we can pass the result into our currently expanding exploit.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Now running our in-process exploit reveals that EIP holds the hex values of the characters that have overridden EIP. In this case, my values are <code>386F4337</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/uniq-fuzz.png" alt="vuln server overwritten registers with pattern"></p>
<p>We can figure out where that may be with another ruby script to calculate our offset:</p>
<p><code>/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q [hex value from EIP]</code></p>
<p>The ruby script spits out an exact offset of 2003. Now we know that to reach the EIP register, it takes 2003 bytes of filler. This also means that 2004-2007 are the 4 bytes that sit in the EIP register. Recall that all 32-bit registers are 4 byte registers because the architecture (32-bit applications) only allows a maximum of 4 concurrent bytes to be transferred at a time. Amazing. We now control the EIP register and can give it exact bytes to execute because we know where it is now. Just for validity&rsquo;s sake however, let us make sure we have done our calculations correctly but sending our own predicted pattern of characters to ensure the registers are where we think.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>If we run our current half-exploit, we can see that the registers have all of the exact values we anticipated.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/validation.png" alt="suspected register values validated"></p>
<p><strong>EBP</strong>: <code>41414141</code> (AAAA)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>EIP</strong>: <code>42424242</code> (BBBB)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>ESP</strong>: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->→<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <code>43434343</code> (CCCC)</p>
<p>From this, we have been able to gather that EBP is just before EIP, and if we take a look at the call stack, we can see that immediately after our Bs were called, Cs were called, meaning that we know ESP is just after EIP as well.</p>
<p><img src="/files/Windows-Exploit-Development-Course/callStack.png" alt="validated call stack"></p>
<p>We control it all, and we now know where EIP is. Recall that the EIP register will execute whatever it is given, so if we can tell EIP to execute something, we might just be able to have it execute our own code to get a shell right? Sort of, but onto crafting our official exploit.</p>

      <p>In short, I am an ever-learning, curious, motivated, and passiontate individual in all topics technology. I get my joy from cracking smiles in any way I can and helping those who are less fortunate than myself, generally with my gift of knowledge in the technological field. I'm pessimistic, doubtful of myself, and I feel I deserve absolutely nothing in life; everything is earned. I'll make it to a point of success on my deathbed, but until then I'll be moving and improving the world and people around me.</p>
