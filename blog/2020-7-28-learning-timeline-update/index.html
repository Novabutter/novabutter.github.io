    <h2 id="professional-career-space-i-got-a-job">Professional Career Space (I got a job)</h2>
<p>After many months of searching, applying, and interviews I got a professional offer from MasterCard and I accepted it. Currently I am a Linux Systems Engineer which is less security than I had preferred but no doubt is an excellent and relevant start to my next chapter in life. I get to be in a terminal where I am most comfortable, there still is security involved, and I get to talk to individuals who can only further advance my knowledge. That was enough for me to sign and so I did.</p>
<p>I started not long ago, but from what I can tell MasterCard truly is a great place to work. My team is fantastic and would seems so very willing to help each other out when we are struggling. I much appreciate my boss who is also quite willing to help with whatever I may need. While nobody seems at all impressed or even able to relate to my security stories I in fairness cannot relate to the same amount of knowledge that they have about the terminal. I am learning quite a bit and am excited for the coming months.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-about-learning">So What About Learning?</h2>
<p>Well quite obviously I do not have any more 14-hour opportunities to learn at once. With my new schedule, I get about 2 hours to myself and sometimes less in a weekday. Things I was not able to finish during the week now are pushed to weekends&hellip;you know the whole adult-lifestyle. It&rsquo;s a killer, yet people still manage to learn and get certifications somehow. There is also this thing people do called <em>living</em>? Never heard of it but I&rsquo;ve been considering trying. I know it is possible, but the amount of hours now has shifted quite significantly.</p>
<p>I still have all those items on my Trello Board that I have plans to accomplish. They now have just shifted from around 6-8 tasks a week down to 3-4. My learning Sprints will look a bit different with less items and longer sprint times. My focus will primarily be on work with an addition of whatever I plan to work on that week personally. Some tasks have been shifted around to better reflect my advancing myself in my current position while still keeping security in mind. Other items will be simply courses that I&rsquo;ll continue to study as much as I can.</p>
<h2 id="updated-learning-timeline">Updated Learning Timeline</h2>
<p><span style="display:block;text-align:center;"><img src="/files/Learning-Timeline-Update/New-Timeline.png" alt="Updated Learning Timeline Chart"></span></p>
<p>As you can see, I still have quite a few items from my previous timeline that have remained on the list. Many of them did not materialize between me moving back home, interviewing for jobs, and just in general being busy. Some of the learning points have been moved so far out into the future that I did not even include them on this chart. Additionally these items compared to the last chart from May are not only more spread out being maybe one a week, but also are more <em>realistic</em>. Over-ambition is fine if you accomplish it, but I have a consistent track record of over-scheduling and failing to meet my intense results. This new learning plan will result in more realistic results. One step at a time right?</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-since-may">Where Am I Since May?</h2>
<p>Last time I posted a learning timeline I had an entire summer plan based on <strong>not</strong> getting a job. The job kind of ruined my plans so I had to adjust. On top of that I had suggested what I was changing in order to better complete the tasks at hand from week-to-week. Between what I had planned and how I was intending to reach said goals, I can reveal an update.</p>
<p>For one, I have done very little system administration projects. Minus a substantial multi-week sidetracking with Hackintoshes I focused primarily on security related items.</p>
<p>Secondly as far as PSNSA (not PCNSE which I was considering) I have studied for the test and had a date set to take the test. An error in PerasonVUE&rsquo;s website resulted in me missing my test entirely, so I have to re-apply to get my certification. I have studied enough already, and might as well take the exam to see how I do. That is coming up quite soon so you should quickly find a report on how I did.</p>
<p>Studying for the OSCP has never left my mind. Some of my friends are studying for the exam now and are much enjoying the course. I however have not been studying specifically for the OSCP with as many items I have in my plans first. PCNSA was to come first and even that has been delayed and thus so was OSCP pre-studying. Make no mistake though I&rsquo;ll be taking that test.</p>
<h2 id="wellwhere-to-now">Well&hellip;Where to Now?</h2>
<p>I am still adjusting to this new way of life with different working hours, eating, and sleeping schedules. For another week or so I expect my productivity to still be a bit off of my game in terms of productivity as I adjust. With my more realistic timeline and re-training focus of my activities with work I have much less doubt that I&rsquo;ll be struggling reaching my goals. While I do not work in security right now, the topic is still very much engraved into my brain. I know I&rsquo;ll be the best one day; right now I am trying to find the balance between workaholic relentless non-stop studies and living/enjoying the life I have around me. There really is only one life I get to live and I have to decide how I will approach taking my shot.</p>

      <p>In short, I am an ever-learning, curious, motivated, and passiontate individual in all topics technology. I get my joy from cracking smiles in any way I can and helping those who are less fortunate than myself, generally with my gift of knowledge in the technological field. I'm pessimistic, doubtful of myself, and I feel I deserve absolutely nothing in life; everything is earned. I'll make it to a point of success on my deathbed, but until then I'll be moving and improving the world and people around me.</p>
